# Nest Services
Overview
Nest Services is a multicloud platform designed to connect users with SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings while enabling suppliers to upload and manage information about the services they provide. The platform is built using Java EE and Spring Boot, allowing for robust and scalable service delivery.

The project utilizes RESTful APIs that accept and return JSON data, facilitating seamless communication between suppliers and users. The platform can be hosted on multiple cloud providers, ensuring high availability, performance, and reliability.

Features
Multi-cloud deployment: The platform supports deployment across different cloud environments to ensure redundancy and better performance.
SaaS services for users: Users can access various SaaS offerings provided by suppliers through the platform.
Supplier APIs: Suppliers can submit service information using standardized JSON payloads, which are integrated into the platform via RESTful APIs.
User dashboard: Provides users with an easy-to-use interface to browse available services and interact with SaaS offerings.
Service Management: Allows suppliers to update, add, or remove services through API endpoints.
Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Spring Boot (Java EE)
Frontend: React.js (or specify another framework if used)
API Format: JSON
Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL (or specify used database)
Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or any specific clouds being used
Authentication: OAuth2 / JWT (for secure login and access control)
System Architecture
The system is designed with a microservices architecture, each service running independently and communicating via RESTful APIs. This allows for easier scaling and maintenance, as well as seamless integration between users and suppliers.

Components:
User Module: Handles user registration, authentication, and access to SaaS services.
Supplier Module: Allows suppliers to register their services, update service details, and manage them via APIs.
Service API: Exposes endpoints for service interaction, such as service discovery, service registration, and service removal.
Cloud Integration: Ensures services are deployable and accessible on multiple cloud platforms for high availability.
